## Hi, I’m Nareman 👋

I’m a consultant focused on **data, digital transformation, and applied AI**.

Most of my work sits in the uncomfortable middle where business problems are ambiguous, data is messy, systems are fragmented, and "AI strategy" exists mostly in slides.

I help translate **real business problems into data and systems that actually work**.

### What I focus on

I’m most interested in problems where things tend to break:

- Translating business questions into data, analytics, and AI designs  
- Building **foundational data and AI infrastructure** in complex or regulated environments  
- Diagnosing why **KPIs, and data initiatives** fail in practice  
- Designing decision frameworks, not just metrics  
- Applying AI pragmatically, with real constraints around data quality, cost, governance, and incentives

I care less about models in isolation, and more about **whether systems survive contact with reality**.
