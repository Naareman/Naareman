# Hi, I'm Nareman 👋

I'm a consultant working at the intersection of **data, digital transformation, and applied AI**.

Most of my work lives in the uncomfortable middle —
where business problems are ambiguous, data is messy, systems are fragmented, and "AI strategy" exists mostly in slides.

I help translate **real business problems into data and AI systems that actually work**, and back again into decisions leaders can act on.

## What I focus on

I'm particularly interested in problems where things tend to break:

- Translating business and policy questions into data, analytics, and AI designs
- Building **foundational data and AI infrastructure** in complex or regulated environments
- Diagnosing why dashboards, KPIs, or AI initiatives fail in practice
- Designing decision frameworks, not just metrics
- Applying AI pragmatically, with constraints like data quality, cost, governance, and incentives in mind

I care less about models in isolation, and more about **whether systems survive contact with reality**.

## Writing & thinking in public

I share my thinking openly while exploring problems — often before they're fully "finished".

On my Substack, I write about:
- Decision design and analytics failures
- Data and AI in complex institutions
- Why averages, dashboards, and "best practices" often mislead
- Practical lessons from building and diagnosing real systems

## How I work

A few principles that shape how I approach problems:

- Start from **decisions**, not data
- Treat constraints as first-class inputs
- Prefer clear mental models over clever solutions
- Assume systems fail in edge cases — and design for that
- Optimize for understanding, not just outputs
