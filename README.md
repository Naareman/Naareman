# Hi, I’m Nareman 👋

I’m a consultant working at the intersection of **data, digital transformation, and applied AI**.

Most of my work sits in the uncomfortable middle — where business problems are ambiguous, data is messy, systems are fragmented, and “AI strategy” exists mostly in slides.

I help translate **real business and policy problems into data and AI systems that actually work** — and back again into decisions leaders can act on.

## What I focus on

I’m most interested in problems where things tend to break:

- Translating business and policy questions into data, analytics, and AI designs  
- Building **foundational data and AI infrastructure** in complex or regulated environments  
- Diagnosing why dashboards, KPIs, and AI initiatives fail in practice  
- Designing decision frameworks, not just metrics  
- Applying AI pragmatically, with real constraints around data quality, cost, governance, and incentives  

I care less about models in isolation, and more about **whether systems survive contact with reality**.

## Writing & thinking in public

I write openly while exploring problems — often before they’re fully “finished”.

On Substack, I write about:
- Decision design and analytics failures  
- Data and AI in complex institutions  
- Why averages, dashboards, and “best practices” often mislead  
- Lessons from building and diagnosing real systems
